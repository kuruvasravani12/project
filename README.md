# project
This is my first project on HTML, java script and CSS. My project is "Coffee House", In this project I used img, action, href tags in html. And in CSS I used bgcolor, background image, position like display etc. Similarly in Js I used tablinks and functions. Based on these I created a web page to improve my skills.
